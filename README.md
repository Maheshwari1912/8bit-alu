# 8bit-alu
**Aim:** The aim of the 8-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is to perform a variety of arithmetic and logical 
operations on 8-bit binary inputs. This unit can serve as a fundamental building block for digital 
systems, such as CPUs or microcontrollers, allowing for efficient data manipulation.
